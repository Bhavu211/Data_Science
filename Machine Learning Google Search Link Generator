Objective:
To generate clickable Google search links for a list of machine learning-related keywords or topics using Python.

ðŸ“Œ Key Steps in the Notebook:
1. Importing Required Libraries
Uses basic Python libraries:

pandas for handling tabular data

IPython.display for rendering clickable HTML links

2. Keyword Input
A list of Machine Learning-related terms is created manually:

topics = ['Supervised Learning', 'Unsupervised Learning', 'Reinforcement Learning', ...]
3. Generating Search URLs
For each topic, a Google search link is created using:

python
Copy code
f"https://www.google.com/search?q={formatted_topic}"
where formatted_topic replaces spaces with "+".

4. Creating a Pandas DataFrame
The topics and corresponding search links are stored in a DataFrame with two columns: Topic and Search Link.

5. Making the Links Clickable
Uses HTML formatting with IPython's HTML() and display() to render the links as clickable in the notebook interface.

ðŸ“Š Output Example:
Topic	Search Link
Supervised Learning	Search Link

âœ… Skills Demonstrated:
String formatting and manipulation
DataFrame creation and display
HTML rendering inside a Jupyter Notebook
Practical use of Python for task automation
