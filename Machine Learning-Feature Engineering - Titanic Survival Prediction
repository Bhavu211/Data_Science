This file focuses on enhancing the predictive accuracy of a machine learning model for the Titanic dataset through advanced feature engineering techniques. Here's a concise summary of its contents:

üßπ Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values: The notebook addresses missing data in the 'Age' and 'Embarked' columns by imputing them with the median and mode, respectively.

Dropping Irrelevant Features: Features like 'Cabin', 'Ticket', and 'Name' are removed due to their high cardinality or lack of predictive value.

üõ†Ô∏è Feature Engineering
Title Extraction: Titles (e.g., Mr, Mrs, Miss) are extracted from the 'Name' column to capture social status and are then mapped to numerical values.

Family Size: A new feature 'FamilySize' is created by combining 'SibSp' and 'Parch' to represent the total number of family members aboard.

IsAlone Indicator: A binary feature 'IsAlone' is introduced to indicate whether a passenger is traveling alone.

Age Binning: The 'Age' feature is binned into categories to reduce the impact of outliers and capture age groups.

Fare Binning: Similarly, 'Fare' is binned into quartiles to handle skewness in fare distribution.

üî¢ Encoding Categorical Variables
Label Encoding: Categorical features like 'Sex', 'Embarked', and the extracted 'Title' are converted into numerical format using label encoding.

üìä Model Building and Evaluation
Model Selection: Various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest are trained on the processed data.

Cross-Validation: K-Fold cross-validation is employed to assess the performance of each model and prevent overfitting.

Performance Metrics: Models are evaluated based on accuracy scores, and confusion matrices are used to visualize true vs. predicted classifications.

‚úÖ Final Predictions
Best Model Selection: The model with the highest cross-validation accuracy is selected for making final predictions on the test dataset.

Submission File: Predictions are saved in a CSV file formatted for submission to platforms like Kaggle.
